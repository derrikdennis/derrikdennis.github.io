 ## Background

In order to create a static webpage, I searched around for a proper resume page that would incorporate Bootstrap 
and came across this [website](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/resume/).  This is a free download.  
I tried to use Hugo, but I found that I really needed to understand the language Go.  At this point, I am not prepared to learn this language.
I will add this to the growing list of items that I want to learn.

## Modifications made to base website

### Projects page

I added my top three projects that I did while in class and added them to a card format.  Each one has:

 - A picture of the app or project
 - The name of the project
 - A link to the project
 - A general description of the project

I also included a background color to separate it from the other areas.

### Experience page

I used my experience from my resume for this page.

### Education page

I incorporated my certificate from the UT Austin Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp and my years at Florida State

### Skills page

I transformed this page  to include two sections: my data analysis skills and my technical skills.

### Interests page

I transformed this page to reflect my interests.  I also added a background image of my garden.


### Awards page

I deleted this page

### General aesthetics

I am using a new color palette for the website as I am not a huge fan of the burnt orange.  Instead I have chosen this as my main scheme

- #2F4454
- #2E151B
- #DA7b93
- #37636F
- #1C3334

I feel this gives the website a much more pleasing view.

I also incorporated a fast forward icon as my tab icon.  I felt this was another way of using my initials, 'DD' in a way that also meant that I was ready to bring a company fast forward.

I welcome any questions or comments you might have!!

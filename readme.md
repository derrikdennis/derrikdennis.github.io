 ## Background

In order to create a static webpage, I searched around for a proper resume page that would incorporate Bootstrap 
and came across this [website](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/resume/).  This is a free download.  
I tried to use Hugo, but I found that I really needed to understand the language Go.  At this point, I am not prepared to learn this language.
I will add this to the growing list of items that I want to learn.

## Modifications made to base website

### Projects page

I am currently in the process of adding a projects page.  Here are the highlights of what I'm currently doing to this page:

 - Adding three new projects.
 - Turning the projects into Bootstrap card format
 - Adding pictures to each of the projects

### Experience page

I am transforming the experience page to incorporate my experience from my resume.

### Education page

I am transforming the education page to incorporate my education from my resume.

### Skills page

I need to transform the skills page to reflect what are my current skills

### Interests page

I need to transform the interests page to reflect what are my current interests


### Awards page

I deleted this page

### General aesthetics

I am using a new color palette for the website as I am not a huge fan of the burnt orange.  Instead I have chosen this as my main scheme

- #2F4454
- #2E151B
- #DA7b93
- #37636F
- #1C3334

I feel this gives the website a much more pleasing view.

I welcome any questions or comments you might have!!
